🧠 Design Guidelines & Extensions

The portfolio draws inspiration from refined dark‑theme websites, balancing modern aesthetics with usability. When extending or customising the design:
	•	Typography and spacing: Use a defined type scale (e.g., 72/56/40/28/20/16) and keep body text within 60–70 characters for readability. Maintain generous whitespace to separate sections.
	•	Colour palette: Stick to dark neutrals and a minimal accent colour. Ensure all text and interactive elements meet WCAG AA contrast requirements.
	•	Section animations: Use GSAP and ScrollTrigger to animate section headings (e.g., outline‑to‑fill effect), card lifts and fading content. Keep animations subtle, with durations around 0.6–0.8 seconds.
	•	Accessibility: Always respect prefers‑reduced‑motion, include keyboard focus styles and describe images with alt attributes.
	•	Performance: Optimise images and icons, use lazy loading where appropriate, and avoid blocking scripts.
